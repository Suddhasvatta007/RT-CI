This folder contains the results obtained from the ML prioritization algorithms for each subject, with reference to RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3. Results are in the form of Excel files. 

Moreover, the supplemental material is reported in a PDF appendix to the paper, which consists of results not reported in the main article, again with reference to research question 1, 2 and 3. Specifically, it reports the plots and Tables excluded from the paper for the lack of space. 

RQ1 folder reports results in terms of RPA for each commit and for each subject, 30 repetitions; the average RPA per subject  and average training and ranking times (means over 30 repetitions) per subject. 

RQ2 folder contains again the RPA per commit for each subject along with the result of the PCA appleid to the metrics and the T^2 statistic used as summery indicator. The transfer obtained entropy values are also reported. Moreover, the RPA results for the scenario with failing tests injected is reported. 

RQ3 reports the results of the constrained scenarios, in which the 25%, 50% and 75% of selected tests are prioritised at each commit. Results are in term of difference of the tests execution times (and failing tests) of predicted ranking with respect to the optimal ranking. Results for each subject are reported. Finally, the folder contains the result of sensitivity analysis on training sample size, in terms of RPA and training time.
